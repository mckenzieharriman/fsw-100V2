      <p class = para>LANGLEY,VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the
        CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
        highlighters.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = para> According to the report, sections of the documents- "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred
        by indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighter policy that
    began at the agencey's inception in 1947.</p>
    <br>
    <p class= para>CIA Director<b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
        historic events, such as:

    </p>
    <br>
     <ul>
         <li>The Cold War</li>
         <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
         <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
